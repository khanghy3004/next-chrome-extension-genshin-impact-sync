# Description
This is a quick and convenient tool to track personal accounts of Genshin Impact users. I do not collect any user information. I just use the official API from Hoyolab.

There are 5 main functions:
- Monitor the amount of resin stored
- Track daily checkin status in game and checkin page shortcut
- Shortcut to Genshin Impact's map view page
- Shortcut to Genshin Impact event page
- Shortcut to Genshin Impact's gift code entry page
